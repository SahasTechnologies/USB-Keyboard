## USB Keyboard
This will act as a keyboard... but look like a USB! What is happening here:
- The SD card will store the payloads, or the file telling what to do when it is plugged in
- The switch will act as a DEBUG v PAYLOAD mode, where you can plug it into your laptop in DEBUG mode to debug it (or take the microsd card if preferred) vs PAYLOAD mode, which will automatically execute the payload
- The USB port is a Male USB-C port, which means that it can plug in like a noraml USB (without a wire) and can plug into almost all laptops, and even phones!
- The whole thing was designed to be as small as possible wth 0402 footprints for all of the resistors and other small electronics

Images are below to see how the parts will fit together.
